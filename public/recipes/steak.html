        <ul class="list-disc pt-4">Ingredients:
            <li>10-oz Ny Strip Steak</li>
            <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 lb Brussels Sprouts</li>
            <li>3/4 lb Potatoes</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Crème Fraîche</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 oz Salted Butter</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Capers</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="list-decimal pt-4 text-left">Steps:
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Prepare the ingredients</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Remove the butter from the refrigerator to soften. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 450°F. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Medium dice the potatoes. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the brussels sprouts; halve lengthwise. Roughly chop the capers.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook & mash the potatoes</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Add the diced potatoes and chopped garlic to the pot of boiling water and cook 16 to 18 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. Add the crème fraîche; season with salt and pepper. Using a fork or potato masher, mash to your desired consistency. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Cover to keep warm.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Roast & dress the brussels sprouts</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Meanwhile, place the halved brussels sprouts on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 14 to 16 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven. Evenly top with the vinegar; carefully stir to coat.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook the steaks</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Pat the steaks dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned steaks. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned. Flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes for medium-rare (125°F), or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board; let rest at least 5 minutes.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Make the caper butter & serve your dish</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">While the steaks rest, in a bowl, combine the softened butter and chopped capers. Mash to thoroughly combine. Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; slice crosswise against the grain. Serve the sliced steaks with the mashed potatoes and dressed brussels sprouts. Top the steaks with the caper butter. Enjoy!</div>
