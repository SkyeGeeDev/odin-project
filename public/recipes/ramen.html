            <li>2 Pastured-Raised Eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 lb Ramen Noodles</li>
            <li>4 oz Mushrooms</li>
            <li>10 oz Baby Bok Choy</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Rice Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Vegetarian Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Light Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
            <li>3 Tbsps East Asian-Style Sautéed Aromatics</li>
            <li>1 tsp Black & White Sesame Seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="list-decimal pt-4 text-left">Steps:
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Prepare the ingredients & make the sauce</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; thinly slice crosswise. In a bowl, whisk together the sugar, vinegar, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of water, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook the eggs</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Carefully add the eggs to the pot of boiling water. Cook 7 minutes for soft-boiled, or until your desired degree of doneness. Leaving the pot of water boiling, using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the cooked eggs to a strainer and rinse under cold water 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. When cool enough to handle, peel the cooked eggs. Season with salt and pepper.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook the vegetables</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">In a large pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the mushroom pieces in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced bok choy and sautéed aromatics (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the bok choy stems are softened and the leaves are wilted. Turn off the heat.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook the noodles</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Add the noodles to the same pot of boiling water, stirring gently to separate. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and rinse under warm water 30 seconds to 1 minute to prevent sticking.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Finish the noodles & serve your dish</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">To the pan of cooked vegetables, add the sauce (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook on medium-high, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat. Stir in the cooked noodles until combined. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the finished noodles topped with the seasoned eggs. Garnish with the sesame seeds. Enjoy!</div>
