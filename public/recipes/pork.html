        <div class="text-2xl pt-4 ">Seared pork roast with a pan sauce that combines tangy shallot, savory soy sauce, brown sugar, and punchy balsamic vinegar. Served over a hearty bed of farro, roasted brussels sprouts, and pickled peppers.</div>
        <ul class="list-disc pt-4">Ingredients:
            <li>1 Pork Roast</li>
            <li>½ cup Semi-Pearled Farro</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Balsamic Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 Shallot</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Light Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>½ oz Sweety Drop Peppers</li>
            <li>1 oz Goat Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Weeknight Hero Spice Blend (Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Smoked Paprika & Whole Dried Parsley)</li>
            <li>½ lb Brussels Sprouts</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="list-decimal pt-4 text-left">Steps:
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Sear & start the pork</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Place an oven rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 450°F. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Line a sheet pan with foil. Pat the pork dry with paper towels; place in a bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Turn to thoroughly coat. In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned pork. Cook, turning occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Turn off the heat. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to one side of the sheet pan. Roast 10 minutes. Leaving the oven on, remove from the oven.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Prepare the ingredients & start the sauce</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Meanwhile, wash and dry the brussels sprouts. Cut off and discard the stem ends; halve the brussels sprouts lengthwise. Place in a bowl; add a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Peel and finely chop the shallot. Roughly chop the peppers. In a bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and 2 tablespoons of water. Season with salt and pepper.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Roast the broccoli & finish the pork</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Carefully transfer the seasoned brussels sprouts to the other side of the sheet pan of partially roasted pork. Return to the oven and roast 15 to 17 minutes for medium (the center may still be slightly pink), or until the pork is cooked to your desired degree of doneness* and the brussels sprouts are tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven. Transfer the roasted pork to a cutting board; let rest at least 5 minutes. </div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook the farro</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Meanwhile, add the farro to the pot of boiling water and cook, uncovered, 18 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Finish the sauce</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">While the pork rests, in the pan of reserved fond, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped shallot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened. Add the sauce (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any fond, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Finish the farro & serve your dish</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">To the pot of cooked farro, add the roasted brussels sprouts, chopped peppers, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper; stir to combine. Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested pork; thinly slice crosswise against the grain. Serve the finished farro topped with the goat cheese (crumbling before adding), sliced pork, and finished sauce. Enjoy!</div>
