        <div class="text-2xl pt-4 ">Tender seared scallops served over creamy risotto topped with a garlic-herb butter, mascarpone, and a topping of artichoke, capers, and garlic finished with a squeeze of fresh lemon.</div>
        <ul class="list-disc pt-4">Ingredients:
            <li>20 oz Sustainably Sourced Sea Scallops</li>
            <li>2 cups Carnaroli Rice</li>
            <li>½ cup Marinated Artichoke Hearts</li>
            <li>1 Shallot</li>
            <li>5 oz Baby Spinach</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Verjus Rouge</li>
            <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup Mascarpone Cheese</li>
            <li>2 oz Garlic & Herb Spreadable Butter</li>
            <li>½ cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Roasted Pistachios</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Capers</li>
            <li>1 bunch Parsley</li>
            <li>1 Lemon</li>
            <li>5 Tbsps Vegetable Demi-Glace</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="list-decimal pt-4 text-left">Steps:
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Prepare the ingredients</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Remove the spreadable butter from the refrigerator to soften. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and small dice the shallot. Quarter and deseed the lemon. Roughly chop the artichokes. Roughly chop the capers. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Roughly chop the parsley leaves and stems. Roughly chop the pistachios.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Start the risotto</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">In a medium pot, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced shallot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the rice and a drizzle of olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Finish the risotto</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">To the pot, add 5 cups of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter); season with salt and pepper. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring frequently, 16 to 18 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Add the spinach. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until wilted. Turn off the heat. Add the softened butter, demi-glace, mascarpone, parmesan, verjus, and the juice of 2 lemon wedges. Stir until thoroughly combined and the butter is melted. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Cook the scallops</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">Meanwhile, pat the scallops dry with paper towels. Using your hands, remove and discard the tough side muscle from each scallop. Season with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned scallops in an even layer. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Flip and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate.</div>
            <li class="text-lg py-2 ">Make the artichoke topping & serve your dish</li>
            <div class="text-sm ">In the pan of reserved fond, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped artichokes, chopped capers, and chopped garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until heated through and combined. Turn off the heat. Add the chopped parsley and the juice of the remaining lemon wedges; stir to combine. Serve the finished risotto topped with the cooked scallops and artichoke topping. Garnish with the chopped pistachios. Enjoy!</div>
